sorting-netowrk using a genetic algorithm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network
This program creates a genetic algorithm to compute the best possible sorting networks given a number of comparators and a network size.
Creates a population size, tests the population, meassures fitness of individuals, then produces offspring based on two parents, 
favoring parents of higher fitness. 
Runs until it reaches generation of variable X.
